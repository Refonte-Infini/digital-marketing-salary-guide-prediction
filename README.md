# Digital Marketing Salary Guide Prediction

## Overview

This project is designed to predict salaries for **Digital Marketing** and related roles in the year 2025. It leverages three advanced models to calculate salary projections, offering data-driven insights for professionals and businesses. The models include:

**1. Bayesian Regression**

- Dynamically adjusts salary predictions by combining historical salary data with new trends and industry information.
- Incorporates uncertainty and variability to provide a range of potential outcomes, useful for fast-evolving fields like Digital Marketing.

**2. Quantile Regression Forests**

- Estimates salary distributions (e.g., median, 75th percentile) for different levels and roles, enabling precise salary benchmarks for entry, mid, and senior-level positions.
- Accounts for variability across skills, locations, and market conditions.

**3. Neural Network Regression**

- Models complex, non-linear relationships between factors like experience, tools, certifications, and job location to predict salaries accurately.
- Incorporates high-dimensional data to capture intricate trends in Digital Marketing salary growth.

**Key Features**

- Structured and unstructured data processing for robust predictions.
- Flexibility to account for emerging tools, certifications, and trends impacting Digital Marketing roles.
- Salary predictions adjusted for demand elasticity and geographic variation.

**Implementation**

The repository provides implementations for each model in Python, JavaScript, and Java. Each language has its dedicated folder containing modular code with sample datasets and step-by-step instructions for usage.

**Applications**

- Professionals can use this guide to benchmark potential salaries and upskill strategically.
- Employers can refine compensation structures for competitive hiring in the Digital Marketing sector.

This project bridges the gap between data science methodologies and Digital Marketing, empowering stakeholders with actionable, data-driven insights for 2025.
